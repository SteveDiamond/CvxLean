Scripts to check that files are styled according to `mathlib` standards (ignoring copyright). 
They are supposed to be run from the root of the repository.

For a single file:
```
./scripts/style/check_style_file.sh <file-path>
```
For all files in a directory:
```
./scripts/style/check_style_dir.sh <dir-path>
```
